                <h2>About Death by Coconut</h2>
                <p>It all started in 2024, when four people were sitting around a fire, debating whether or not people actually got killed regularly by falling coconuts. Then, because alcohol, we decided we should start a rock band called "Death by Coconut" that would debut the band's world tour in 2028.</p>
                <p>Death by Coconut officially launched in 2025, bringing together one talented musician (Bill), one kind of talented musician (Noah), one learning musician (Nick), and two no talent hacks that are working at it (Tom and Bob) with a shared vision for creating powerful, uncompromising heavy music. Our sound combines metal, rock, and pretty much anything that doesn't suck, creating a unique sonic experience that has captivated audiences worldwide, including our roughly four fans.</p>
                <p>From our first rehearsal to our upcoming shows, we're building something special. Our journey is just beginning, and we can't wait to share our music with metal fans around the world.</p>
                <p>Stay tuned for updates on our debut album, music videos, and tour dates. The best is yet to come!</p>
